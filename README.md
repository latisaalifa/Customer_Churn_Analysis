# Customer Churn Exploratory Data Analysis
## Project Background
In today's competitive landscape, losing customers is more expensive than acquiring new ones. This project dives deep into customer behavior patterns to answer a critical business question: Why do customers leave, and how can we stop them?
## Key Features
- Churn Dashboard: Centralized monitoring of key churn indicators and customer groups.
- Customer Profiling: Detailed analysis of what makes customers stay or leave.
- Actionable Insights: Concrete strategies tailored to different customer segments.
## The Problem
Our analysis revealed a 20% churn rate, it's meaning that we're losing 1 in every 4 customers. This isn't just a number but also implied that $18,593M in lost annual revenue and significantly higher customer acquisition costs.

**Insight**
- The analysis reveals a 20% churn rate, meaning the company is losing 1 out of every 5 customers. This is a clear warning sign of a serious retention issue. Benchmarking against industry standards is needed to understand the severity of this figure.
- The lost revenue of 18,593M indicates that the company has lost a substantial number of customers and a significant amount of potential income.
- Germany has the highest churn at 814 customers, followed closely by France at 810, while Spain has the lowest at 413. The churn gap between Germany/France and Spain is nearly double, suggesting specific issues such as poor service quality, stronger competition, or underperforming sales teams in those markets.
- Female customers churn more than male customers, with a difference of over 200 customers or roughly 27%. This indicates that gender may be a key driver of churn, possibly due to differing needs, expectations, or service experiences.
- Customers with only one product are the most vulnerable to churn, whereas those with three or four products show much lower churn rates. This suggests that higher product adoption increases customer attachment and reduces the likelihood of leaving.
- Customer activity is a major factor influencing churn. Inactive customers churn almost twice as much as active customers. Low engagement likely leads customers to feel less connected or perceive insufficient value, making them more likely to switch to competitors.
- Churn is highest among customers with 1–3 years of tenure, indicating that the early stages of the customer journey are the most critical. After passing this period, the churn rate becomes more stable and significantly lower.
## Recommendation
- Launch Create and aggressively market attractive bundles (internet+ phone + streaming) with discounted pricing.
- Establish a dedicated check-in process for customers in their first 6 months, offering setup support, feature tutorials, and a dedicated contact.
- Allocate marketing and retention budget specifically for Germany and France. Launch localized campaigns that address potential market-specific issues ("Network Upgrade Guarantee").
- Create alerts for customers who show signs of inactivity (usage drop) or dissatisfaction (multiple support tickets). Automate a personalized "We miss you" offer.
- Analyze usage patterns by gender and tailor product recommendations and marketing communications accordingly.
